"""TapLearn

  Once finished, <<<TapLearn>>> should be a generic example of pedagogical application with a touch interface, to be used to study the effect of various features on both persistence and learning. In its most basic version, the application downloads a sequence of predicates from a server, present them to the learner in a random order, each to be validated or refuted by the learner, gives feedback to the user and submits the user's answers to a central server for later studies. The features envisioned include the addition of animations, colors, sounds, spaced memorization techniques. The studies envisioned include the effect of those features on <<<persistence>>> (how frequently and how long the learner uses the application) and <<<learning>>> (how fast the learner progresses in his/her learning).
